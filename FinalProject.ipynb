    "Our team is analyzing Chicago Crimes Data to understand the different kinds of crimes in our communities. We are also trying to understand the econmoic factors that contribute to crime by looking at a SocioEconomic Indicator data set. By merging the above two data sets, we hope to get a better understanding of how crime is affected by the various socioeconomic factors particularly employement and income. \n"

    "When first starting the project, our group wanted to use the Crimes data set along with CTA Lstops data set to find crimes around CTA stops. After spending several weeks and trying to find a valid common data to be merged on, we realized that merging these two datasets is near impossible. Our group then decided to use our SocioEconomic data set with crimes as they both share columns where the data can be compared and matched with. "

    "The Crimes Data set had about 8 million rows and was extremely large. In order to narrow this down and let this match with our SocioEconomic data set, we filtered the year to start from 2008. The years for both the data sets are from 2008-2020 We also made sure to remove null values and delete a few unwanted columns from both the data sets. The SocioEconomic data set didn't need a lot of removal of the columns. We merged Crime data set along with our SocioEconomic data set leading to about 4million rows worth of data. After Data cleaning, we were able to get 12 years worth of valid data. Some of the columns from the final merged dataframe, we see the locations, descriptions, Arrest along with the community of where these occured. We are also able to see the population, education and income information from the merged data. "
