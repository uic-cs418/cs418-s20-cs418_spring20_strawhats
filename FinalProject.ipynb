    "The Crimes Data set had about 8 million rows and was extremely large. In order to narrow this down and let this match with our SocioEconomic data set, we filtered the year to start from 2008. The years for both the data sets are from 2008-2020 We also made sure to remove null values and delete a few unwanted columns from both the data sets. The SocioEconomic data set didn't need a lot of removal of the columns. We merged Crime data set along with our SocioEconomic data set leading to about 4million rows worth of data. After Data cleaning, we were able to get 12 years worth of valid data. Some of the columns from the final merged dataframe, we see the locations, descriptions, Arrest along with the community of where these occured. We are also able to see the population, education and income information from the merged data. "
